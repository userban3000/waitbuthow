Description from curseforge:

*Ever wanted a guided experience through modded Minecraft but had no idea where to start? Expert packs too difficult? Getting easily lost in kitchen sinks? We've got you covered! Welcome to waitbuthow.*

*The modpack is based on 3 stages of Tech and 3 stages of Magic, with another more alternative Adventure stage. The pack is intended as a intermediate experience, where everything is neatly explained in-game through Quests, but you're challenged to use what you learn.*

*The progression system is designed to never overwhelm you, but always provide you things to do. Additionally, there is no crossover between different trees, but some exists in single trees. For example, Magic items aren't used in the Tech tree, but the later Chapters of Tech will have you using things you've previously unlocked.*

*Another main focus is performance and stability. We've taken all the steps to ensure an optimal experience. No bloat and no unfinished or weird behaving mods. waitbuthow is an experience that is designed to be experienced as cleanly as possible.*
